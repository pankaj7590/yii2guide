LinkPager displays a list of hyperlinks that lead to different pages of target.

LinkPager works with a yii\data\Pagination object which specifies the total number of pages and the current page number.

Note that LinkPager only generates the necessary HTML markups. In order for it to look like a real pager, you should provide some CSS styles for it. With the default configuration, LinkPager should look good using Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework.
